== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is the trustmark? =

The McAfee SECURE trustmark lets website visitors know that a website has been tested and certified to meet our security standards. When a website is certified as secure, it can display the trustmark. When it no longer meets our standards, the trustmark vanishes until the standards are met.

= What does this plugin do that other WordPress security plugins don't do? =

The McAfee SECURE trustmark is designed to let internet users know which websites are certified as safe to use. Other security badges indicate whether or not sites have purchased additional levels of protection, including SSL certificates and privacy badges. Often times, a site will use multiple security products to certify and scan their site for different types of vulnerabilities.

= Will the McAfee SECURE trustmark work with other Security plugins I have on my site? =

Yes. Often we require certified sites to have multiple layers of security including SSL certificates and perimeter and behind the firewall vulnerability scanning. In many cases, a website will have several security services in place along with McAfee SECURE certification.

= Why isn't the trustmark showing up on my site? =

The McAfee SECURE trustmark is temporarily revoked for any domain that fails to meet our security standards for over 72 hours. The McAfee SECURE trustmark mark is temporarily replaced with a transparent image. If this occurs, log in to your account and view your violations. As soon as we determine that the domain meets our requirements, the trustmark will reappear.
